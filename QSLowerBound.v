(* the queueing system is lower bounded if all of its generated sequences of events respect the number

Definition lower_bounded := forall w, generates w -> init_items + count_buffer w >= min_items.

(*
  We can construct a function f that gives the minimum number of items in the buffer in a given state following
 this constraints:
  -> f applied to the initial state gives a number less or equal to the number of initial items
  -> for every tangible state q, f applied to every transition starting from q through e gives a number less or
    equal to f applied to q plus count_event e

  We shall now prove that this constraints are correct.
